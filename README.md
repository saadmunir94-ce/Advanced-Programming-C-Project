# Advanced-Programming-C++-Project
This project implements forward simulation of a strategy game called "Starcraft 2" in C++ using object-oriented principles and STL library. Later on, I implemented a genetic algorithm for optimizing build lists to minimize the time taken for generating a given number of specific attackers while also ensuring the build list still remains valid.
