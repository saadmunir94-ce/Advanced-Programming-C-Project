# Advanced-Programming-C++-Project
This project involves implementing the forward simulation of a strategy game called "Starcraft 2" in C++, employing object-oriented principles and the STL library. Subsequently, a genetic algorithm is employed to optimize valid build lists, with the objective of minimizing the time required to generate a specific number of given attackers.
